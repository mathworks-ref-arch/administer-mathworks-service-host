WARNING: The provided <installation_directory> does not match the value of
    MATHWORKS_SERVICE_HOST_MANAGED_INSTALL_ROOT environment variable as set for
    the current user ($env:USERNAME).
    Set the environment variable to <installation_directory> of the
    admin-controlled-installation of MathWorks Service Host for all users that
    use MathWorks products.
    If the environment variable points to a previous installation, MathWorks
    products will continue to use that older version
    ($env:MATHWORKS_SERVICE_HOST_MANAGED_INSTALL_ROOT).
